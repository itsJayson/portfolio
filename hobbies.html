<p  align="justify" style="font-family:'Courier New'">Beatboxing has been my remedy for boredom 
    since I was nine years old. It uplifts my mood and serves as a creative outlet.
    I even joined a beatbox battle in Pasig, which further fueled my passion. 
    The rhythmic patterns and vocal percussions bring me joy and create a positive 
    atmosphere, making beatboxing an integral part of my life.</p>

    it's solving complex problems, building innovative applications, or creating elegant algorithms,
    programming constantly challenges and excites me. It's a world where creativity meets logic,

    than just a skill; it has become my true passion and a driving force in my life.</p>
